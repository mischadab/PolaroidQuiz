# PolaroidQuiz

For this assignment I built a page that contained a quiz. The quiz has 5 questions and a time limit to finish in. 
If you get the answer correct, you move on to the next question
If you get the answer wrong, you move on to the next question but you lose 10 seconds on your timer.

At the end of the quiz, there is a form to submit your name and it keeps track of your score.
